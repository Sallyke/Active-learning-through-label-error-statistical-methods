# Active-learning-through-label-error-statistical-methods

Highlightsï¼š
We define two label error statistics functions and build clustering-based practical statistical models to guide block splitting.
We propose a center-and-edge instance selection strategy to choose critical instances.
We design an algorithm called active learning through label error statistical methods (ALSE).
Results of significance test verify the superiority of ALSE to state-of-the-art algorithms.
